# Release Notes - v2.1.0

## New Feature: Mood Overview

You can now view all your configured Homey moods through your AI assistant!

**What's new:**
- Ask Claude "What moods do I have configured?" to see all your moods
- Moods are displayed with their zone locations in the home structure
- Each mood shows its name and the number of devices it controls

**Example queries:**
- "What moods do I have configured?"
- "Show me the moods in the living room"
- "Which zones have moods?"

**Note:** Due to Homey API limitations, mood activation through AI is not supported. However, you can create custom flows using the "AI Tool call" trigger card if you want to activate moods through Claude.
