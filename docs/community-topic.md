## What is AI Chat Control?

AI Chat Control brings the power of AI to your smart home by connecting your Homey to advanced AI assistants like Claude. Using natural language, you can ask your AI assistant to control devices, trigger flows, and get information about your home - all without navigating through apps or remembering exact commands.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language device control
- Custom Flow triggers with parameters
- AI-powered smart queries ("Which windows are open?")
- Zone control support
- Compatible with any MCP-enabled AI assistant

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:**
- Homey Pro (2023) or newer (firmware >=12.4.0)
- Computer and Homey on the same local network
- AI assistant with MCP support (e.g., Claude Desktop)

**Installation:**
1. Install the app from the Homey App Store
2. Find your Homey's IP address (Homey app ‚Üí More ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About)
3. Configure your AI assistant (see full documentation for detailed instructions)

**Example Commands:**
- "What devices do I have in my home?"
- "Turn on all lights in the living room"
- "What's the temperature in the bedroom?"
- "Which windows are open right now?"

## Creating Custom Commands

The real power comes from creating custom commands using the **"AI Tool call"** Flow trigger card. This card teaches your AI assistant what your Flow does and triggers it with parameters.

**Quick Example:**
1. Create a Flow with the "AI Tool call" trigger
2. Configure: Command `play_radio`, Description "Play a radio station", Parameters `streamUrl: string`
3. Use the `{{Parameter 1}}` token in your Flow actions
4. Ask your AI: "Play BBC1 on the kitchen radio"

For detailed parameter syntax, examples, and troubleshooting, see the **[full documentation](https://jvmenen.github.io/homey-ai-chat-control/)**.
