# AI Chat Control for Homey

Control your Homey smart home using AI assistants like Claude through natural language conversations.

## What is this?

AI Chat Control connects your Homey to AI assistants like Claude Desktop. Simply talk to Claude in natural language to control devices, trigger flows, and get information about your home.

**Examples:**

- "Turn on the living room lights"
- "Which windows are open?"
- "Set the thermostat to 21 degrees"
- "What was the temperature in the living room yesterday at 2pm?"
- "Show me the energy consumption of the washing machine this week"
- "Which flows use my bedroom lamp?"

## Quick Start

1. Install the app from the Homey App Store
2. Find your Homey's local IP address
3. Configure Claude Desktop with this config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homey": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://[YOUR-HOMEY-IP]:3000/mcp",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop and ask: "What devices do I have in Homey?"
